## **Part 1**

## 1. Weekly journaling 

***
#### Week 2

- This is my first day of class since I unfortunately missed the previous 2 days for personal reasons. I learned about different operating systems, bash, and how to use Chat GPT. I didn't know that Chat GPT was updating to 4o, so this is exciting news to me.

- Today we talked about operating systems some more. We went over how to navigate folders by using bash and then talked about how to use Chat GPT some more. I already had some experience with Chat GPT, but I still managed to learn something new today. I didn't know that we could ask Chat GPT for the prompt that is used when we ask a broader question, so I am gonna try to use that in my own time as well.

- Felipe taught this lecture and talked about git. I used to think that Git and GitHub were the same thing, but I’m glad this class cleared up my confusion. While they both involve pushing folders into repositories for safekeeping/collaboration, they differ in how GitHub is GUI while Git is CLI. I found that interesting, and will definitely use it for my future collaborative projects

#### Week 3

- I caught a fever, so I’m unable to attend class today. I participated on Zoom instead. I am a little lost on what was being talked about but I'm sure I can catch up. The introduction of this lecture gave me ideas on what I could make with AI to improve people's lives. My mind immedietly jumped to how it can be used in the animation industry. Even though breakthroughs have already been made with programs like Sora, I am interested in if it can be used to translate 2D scenes into 3D. We also covered bash some more. Using command line and bash to create task automation was something I didn't know I could do, so I'll look into it more.

- I still have a cough, so I used Zoom once again. The audio of the second half of the lecture was gone, so I left the Zoom call confused about what was being talked about. Besides that, we covered the command line, bash, and vim today. I found out that the remote server has two underlying components, bash and C shell, and I'm a little curious how they differ from each other. 

- We learned more about Unix this time. Before, I thought that Unix was a search engine like Google, but now I know that I mixed it up with Linux. Unix is a way of organizing file hierarchies that is still used today. I found it helpful when he spoke about the history of Unix to give background information. On top of that, we also covered cat, and file permissions, and brushed up on some bash.

#### Week 4

- Even though we have seen pipes and filters before, we got formally introduced to them today. Pipes and filters allow us to chain simple bash commands togehter, with the output of the last command used as the input of the next. Besides that, we also went through cat, file permissions, and grep with more examples. 

- Haussi gave some sample midterm questions (both C and multiple choice) for us to try out. I didn’t know how to solve some of them without ChatGPT, so I’ll have to study some more just in case. Once again, we went through bash and vim commands. I find vim very challenging to use, even though its supposidly better than emacs. I find that I get stuck a lot, and I wouldn't be able to interact with anything. 

- Midterm A was today. I just found out that we had a practice midterm last night, so I gave it a go. I think I did pretty good on it, but I couldn't tell for sure since the long answers weren't marked. Both midterms were not hard with ChatGPT’s help. I thought it was weird that pointers were covered in the midterm, but that could just be to practice researching with ChatGPT. There was a typo in one of the questions, so I'm going to ask about it later.
#### Week 5

-  I had to join on Zoom today. We went through midterm solutions, and I don’t remember which question I got wrong. Even so, I do know I did pretty well. We started talking about pointers in today’s lecture. I have some background with this because of CSC 230. This is very similar to how values are stored in memory with assembly, which is to be expected because C is also a low-level language. Strangely enough, I found pointers to also be somewhat similar to nodes in how you can have different variables point to others. This is probably an inaccurate description of pointers, but I believe that the similarities are still there.

- The lecture was about reading and writing files. This is pretty similar to the Python course, but it has so many extra layers that I never thought to consider. I got confused on buffers, fputs(), etc., so I’ll have to study it later. I already finished the file reading part of the assignment, so it is a shame that I wouldn't really have a chance to properly apply what I learned today. Right now, I'm just worried about completing the assignment on time, since getting the values from the file is proving to be challenging.

- This time we covered structs. I think this would’ve been helpful for assignment 1, but my current solution (although longer) seems to be working too. Haussi tried to do more class participation too. Although it was a good idea, I think that most people were spacing out too much to know what was going on. At first, structs seem similar to Java objects to me, but now I think they are more similar to arrays, except you can use multiple types in it.

#### Week 6

- I thought that class started at 1:30 pm instead of 12:20 pm, so I missed this lecture. I’ll review the recording later.

- There were not that many people in class today, maybe only 14 total. Even though this is to be expected if lectures are recorded, it is still jarring how a once full classroom can get so empty. We talked about Python today. I took CSC 110, so I know some of the basic functions of the language, but there is still new information that I learned today. Firstly, there are over 2,000 libraries in Python, which was a little less than our initial guess of 10,000. I also found out about module guards like __name__. 

- Haussi went over copilot and his general proccess for generating python code. He did it by asking Chat GPT one function at a time instead of requesting big swaths of code at once. He also talked about various python operations like fstrings, importing modules, and type hints. 

## 2. What is the core functionality of Jupyter Notebooks?

***

Jupyter Notebook blends code, text, and images seamlessly to enhance comprehension and clarity when sharing complex ideas. It also allows you to run code in the program, combining all the user necessities into one environment.

## 3. Summarize simple Jupyter Notebook markdown
***

Markdown is a language that allows users to format a document into symbols, links, images, just to name a few. I will be covering some of the basic funciton such as how to make proper headings, sections, and how to insert links and images below

1. **Headings**:

You can make headers by including "# " before your title of choice. The more hashtages you include, the smaller the font of your heading. The heading otions are labeled from 1 to 6, with 1 being the largest font size, and 6 being the smallest

# Heading 1
## Heading 2
### Heading 3
#### Heading 4
##### Heading 5
###### Heading 6

<br>

2. **Sections**:

Sections can be established with the help of section breaks, which uses horizontal line to separate one part from another. You can create a section break by typing 3 or more "*", "-" or "_" in a row where you want the line to appear

<br>

section 1
***
section 2
----
section 3
_____
section 4

<br>

3. **Links**:

While simply pasteing a hyperlink into a file will do the trick, sometimes you might want to make it look nicer or convey additional information to the reader with labels. Use "[titleName]" to determine the title that will visually replace the link, "(linkName)" to hold the link and its hover-label, and add quotes after the link in the round brackets to define the label that will appear when you hover you mouse on the title.

Standard Links With Mouse-Over Titles<br>
[click this link](http://en.wikipedia.org "Wikipedia") <br><br>

4. **Images**:

Images can be inserted through markdown by adding a "!" before "[](imageURL "Mouse-over titles")". It doesnt matter what you write in the square brackets, since it would not show up

## 20. What are your personal insights, aha moments, and epiphanies you experienced in the first part of the SENG 265 course?
---
Before this course, I was too intimidated by the command line, as it seemed like something out of a movie. The lack of GUI and simplistic black-and-white design made it seem a lot scarier to me than it actually was. I remember back in CSC115, we had the option to use the terminal to run Java files. Even though it was encouraged by our professor, I decided to only use the built-in "run" button of VS Code because of the unfamiliarity I had with the terminal. Now, I know what most of the basic functions are, and I can not only compile files, but elaborate on my knowledge of other languages, do bash commands, and use git.

I've already listed most of my epiphanies in the weekly journaling section, but I will do a brief explanation of what stuck out to me about ChatGPT. Even though I already use ChatGPT for my coding projects, I didn't know the full extent of what you could do with it. I did not know you could relocate what prompt was used to generate code, and I didn't fully understand the best technique to use this tool. Before, I would only give it my faulty code and then ask it to fix it. This did not work very well because my code is often hundreds of lines long, making the request too complex for it to process. Now I realize that I should slowly work with it bit by bit to fully utilize its strengths. In doing it incrementally, I avoid the risk of complicated requests, maximizing productivity and quality.

## 21. How did you experience Generative AI tools such as chatGPT, CoPilot, or Perplexity as a learning tool?
---
I find that Gen AI (more specifically ChatGPT) works wonderfully as a learning tool if done right. So far, I have only used ChatGPT for CSC, Math, and English courses, so my opinions are limited by that. However, my experience has been relatively positive.

For Computer Science, I use it for help with both coding and theories. I found it works better with coding, as it is well within the "Jagged Frontier" of what it can do. However, it has mixed results with proofs and theorems, as I found that it sometimes tries to force a proof, connecting unrelated or incorrect information. I did find that its foundational logic is generally correct, so I often use it to spark ideas of what the actual proof can be.

For math, I find that the results are similar to what is found with ChatGPT's Computer Science proofs. They have the right base, but didn't have the right execution. However, this problem largely vanishes if I subscribe to ChatGPT's service, as it now has access to an actual calculator.

Gen AI is especially useful in English. When I have to write research essays, it can scan the internet to find good quality scholarly articles for me to draw my information from. I found that the results are way more accurate than what search engines like Google can produce. Additionally, I am able to run the article through ChatGPT to summarize key points to see if this article actually has relevant information. Of course, I still read through the article just in case, but this feature saves me a lot of time. Lastly, I sometimes struggle to find a way to properly express my thoughts. Everything I want to say is on the tip of my tongue, but I just can't find the proper words or sentence structure to express it. That is where ChatGPT comes in. I write my crudely formatted sentence as a prompt for it, and it gives me a much better way to say it. Sometimes it uses too much flowery language, but it is always easier to reduce information than to add it.

Overall, I believe that Gen AI is an amazing learning tool, and my work has gotten more efficient and improved in quality because of it. I'm also glad that this course delves into the proper ways to use it, as I don't think I've seen another course (computer science or otherwise) that does this.

## **Part 2**

## 1. How useful is SENG 265 for building your resume for future co-op applications and future job applications?

***

I believe that SENG 265 plays an important role in building resumes for co-op and job applications. Initially, I thought this course was just about learning C, but I soon discovered it covers so much more.

Besides learning C, we have also explored Python and web development languages like HTML. Over these past few years, Python has become one of the most popular languages due to its vast libraries and straightforward syntax, making it a popular choice for companies to adopt. Before this course, I only knew the basic skills from CSC110. Now, these foundations have been expanded upon, and I have learned about the inner workings of the language, from stacks and heaps to OOP. These new skills are valuable for job applications since they're likely what companies are looking for in cadidates.

I've also learned about proper software development practices and conventions. While I was already vaguely aware of concepts like tacit knowledge, SOC, HC, and LC, it was still beneficial to formally cover these topics in this course. Tacit knowledge is not only useful for interacting with clients but also for interviewers. In a way, interviewers could be considered your clients because you're trying to "sell" your skills and talents to them. Empathy programming works hand in hand with tacit knowledge, as you need to practice patience and put yourself in the client's shoes to communicate effectively. These software development principles are necessary for job applications.

Lastly, a key component of SENG 265 is the use of AI. We were encouraged to use it and were taught how to generate prompts to get the best results. I found the integration of AI particularly useful, not only within class  but also for personal projects to include in my resume. With its help, I am in the process of creating a website with Flask and Vue to showcase artistic protection services. These services include watermarking, AI disturbance overlays, and possibly steganography if I have time. AI has increased my efficiency tenfold. Before, I would spend hours on Google looking for the right articles, but now it's like having a personal tutor. Learning to generate code is a crucial skill, and I'm glad I could hone this skill through this class. In the competitive job market, I hope ChatGPT's help will enable me to create impressive and imaginative projects that make me stand out from my competitors.

## 5. What is the difference between pythonic and non-pythonic code?

***

Pythonic code follows the philosophies of Tim Peters' writing: "The Zen of Python." This emphasizes functionality alongside readability and simplicity. It takes full advantage of Python operations (like list comprehensions), built-in functions, and libraries. Pythonic code also adheres to the rules outlined in PEP 8 (elaborated in part 16 of the term portfolio below), which adds to the code's readability and maintainability, as it’s a standard shared between all Python developers.

On the other hand, non-Pythonic code often disregards attempts at simplification. Even though non-Pythonic code might work, it's far from the optimum solution, as it usually takes up extra lines of code and doesn’t fully utilize Python operations. A big disadvantage of deviating from Pythonic conventions is the lack of code standardization between developers, leading to issues with readability and maintainability.

While I understand the appeal of Pythonic code, I do feel like there’s a learning curve to implementing it. Sometimes, making the code shorter can make it less readable to newer Python developers. Take list comprehensions as an example. Although I can read them, it’s a tough process because the logic is more compact compared to a regular loop. Pythonic code is actually very similar to slang or acronyms in that sense. Although I might be able to deduce what an acronym means, it isn’t very obvious to less experienced speakers. That’s why I feel like extremely Pythonic code is a double-edged sword.
## 6. Describe the concepts and applications of object & class variables and object & class methods.

***
#### Variables

Class variables are shared across all instances of a class. They belong to the class itself rather than any specific instance, and are often used for data that is common to all instances (e.g., object count, constants). These variables are defined inside the class but outside any instance methods. You can access class variables either through the class itself (Class.class_variable) or an instance of the class (obj.class_variable).

On the other hand, object variables are specific to each instance of a class. They belong to the object itself and are used to store data that varies between objects (e.g., age, name). These fields are defined in the init function and are accessible through 'self' within the class (self.field) and by the object name outside the class (obj.field).

### Methods

Class methods relate to the class itself, not its instances. They are used for operations involving the class in general, like updating class variables. These methods are declared with the @classmethod decorator and take 'cls' as the first parameter to represent the class.

Object methods, however, are for specific class instances. They take 'self' as the first parameter and are used to perform tasks involving the instance's fields (e.g., setters, getters).
## 8. Describe the importance of implicit or tacit knowledge in requirements engineering and job interview dialogues as discussed in class.

***

Tacit or implicit knowledge is gained through experience. This applies to almost any task or activity, including programming. Often, people get caught up in their bubble of familiarity and forget how alien their environment might feel to outsiders or newcomers. Properly extracting and interpreting this tacit knowledge is key to successful interactions between clients and interviewers, promoting healthy communication between all parties.

Tacit knowledge often goes both ways. Programmers have implicit knowledge of coding, while customers have implicit knowledge of their expectations. Both are hard to express since clients might not have a background in computer science, and developers might not know exactly what customers want to accomplish. Successful communication can bridge this gap by asking thoughtful questions in a way the other person can understand. However, this interaction itself is a form of tacit knowledge, only gained through experience.

Interviewers are likely to test your implicit knowledge and your ability to extract it. Along with your programming skills, they will look for your ability to ask questions, a skill that is useful in client interactions and team settings. They will assess how well you handle non-verbal cues and utilize past experiences to make informed decisions. All of this will contribute to how well you fit into their company.ands

## 16. Summarize PEP 8 and be prepared to answer questions about PEP 8 in the final exam. 

***

PEP 8 is a Python styling convention that helps programmers create readable and consistent code. This is crucial for ensuring other programmers can understand your code's purpose and logic, enabling smoother collaboration, integration, and debugging. PEP 8 covers various conventions such as code layout, comments, and naming. Here are some notable examples to keep in mind:

#### Code Layout:
- Indentation is 4 spaces. When splitting longer lines, make an extra indent to distinguish the continuation.
- Lines should be 79 characters long.
- Use two blank lines between top-level function/class definitions, a single blank line between methods, and single blank lines within functions to distinguish logical sections.
- Group imports in the following order: standard library, related third party, and local application/library-specific imports. Each import should be on a separate line.
- Dunders (double underscores) are placed after the module docstring and before imports.
- Avoid extraneous or trailing whitespace in specific scenarios.

#### Comments:
- Comments should be complete sentences and properly capitalized.
- Block comments should be one paragraph or more.
- Inline comments should be separated by at least two spaces from the statement.
- Docstrings should use triple quotes.

#### Naming:
- Avoid nondescript names.
- Use underscores for variables and functions.
- Use camel case for class names.
- Use all uppercase for constants.

- ## 17. Describe at least five of your favourite libraries in the Python ecosystem.

***

This is a hard question to answer because of the sheer number of libraries out there.

#### 1. Flask
This library has really impressed me during these past few weeks of using it. There are so many packages within it, each with their own specific functionalities to aid with web development. Flask primarily works with the back-end side of web development, managing requests (like GET, POST, and PUT), routing, and dynamic template rendering. I remember doing something similar with Vue a while ago, and there was a steep learning curve that I found hard to overcome. Flask is more straightforward and user-friendly, in my opinion, making it an excellent choice for beginners.

#### 2. Pillow
Like Flask, I am fairly new to this library, but I have already grown to like it a lot. This library specializes in image manipulation, allowing you to overlay multiple images, resize them, and much more. A tool that I found most helpful was the .show() method, which automatically shows you the output of the final image, so you don't have to take time to open the file manually. It's the little quality-of-life operations that I love the most.

#### 3. Random
This library has impressed me with how much you can do with it. Random allows you to generate a sequence of random numbers using a generator from a seed of your choice. Previously, I used it in CSC 110 to randomize dice rolls for a gambling game assignment. However, now I know that you can use it not only for games but also to calculate integrals. This was a method I had not considered before, and it leaves me wondering what else you can do with this library.

#### 4. Doctest
I'm pretty sure this is the first library I ever used in Python. Its purpose is short and sweet, allowing you to test cases to ensure proper functionality for your methods. You write your tests inside the docstring of your functions, accounting for all edge cases. Through this library, you can not only assist with testing but also improve the readability of your function code. Even though I rarely use this library anymore, it is still one of my favorites.

#### 5. Typing
This is a library that ultimately helps with quality of life. It gives you the ability to provide type names to variables, arguments, and return values. It is especially useful for debugging and making code more readable in general. What's great about this library is that it doesn't only have hints for default Python types; you can even create your own types. In general, I think this library is really flexible and contributes to a more readable program.

## 18. Document your continued learning experience in SENG 265.

***

#### Week 7

- I briefly learned about PEP 8 conventions in CSC 110, and I found it interesting that older languages like C don't enforce similar conventions. We also learned more about operations you can use on formatted strings, such as manipulating text alignment. Looking back, this would have made my life in CSC 110 a lot easier, especially with that assignment where we had to print right triangles. Before, I had to use a variable to add an extra space to each line. But now I can use the alignment feature to automatically make the triangle right-justified!

- When I saw the number of built-in functions in Python's default library, I was initially a little shocked because there were so many. I remember in CSC 110, we weren't allowed to use those functions and had to implement each from scratch. This was for good reason, as it helped with learning the language. However, knowing that these built-in functions exist does make life easier nowadays since these implementations are already optimized and save time. We also learned about call by value (CBV) vs. call by reference (CBR), which made me think back to assembly. I remember it being a large part of the course, where we had different ways of passing a parameter—by value or by memory address. It was interesting to see the similarities and differences of CBV and CBR between Python and assembly. In Python, it is defined by the type of parameter passed into the function since we cannot access memory addresses.

- This was my first time learning about the yield statement. I'm a bit confused about how it works, but I kind of get the idea. It saves where we left off before returning a value so that we can return the next value of the sequence the next time we use the function. We also brushed over the different types of collections. So far, I knew most of them, but there were some things that I didn't know before, such as the deque and certain operations.

#### Week 8

- We learned about incremental software development today. I found it interesting that this same principle applies to generating code through ChatGPT. You get the best results if you add functionality bit by bit, as you add more details to your initial request. Add a little, test a little, and repeat. We also learned about tacit/implicit knowledge today. I think that sometimes, we get preoccupied with our own little bubble of CSC and SENG and forget that some terms and knowledge are not widely known outside our field. We have to learn how to communicate with clients and interviewers in a way they can easily understand, which is not always easy.

- We learned about slicing today, which is an operation you can use to cut out a certain section of an array of any kind (including strings). However, I don't entirely understand the difference between slicing and islice. I guess it's for all iterators, but doesn't slicing work for all iterators anyway? I'll look into that. I think I understand yield statements now. When we call a function with yield statements, it creates a generator that you can iterate through afterward. That makes more sense to me now.

- We had midterm B today. I think it went well, but I'll have to see when the marks come back.

#### Week 9

- It's reading break :)

- I found it interesting how empathy and morality are such key concepts in STEM fields, especially engineering. Up until this point, I have only really considered how empathy for others could create a healthy team environment. I have yet to consider other applications of empathy in the workplace, such as using it to solve problems navigating UI and other quality-based uses. I love how we not only learn a wide array of languages in this class but also how to improve our chances of getting a job in this industry, a challenge I am facing right now.

- I understand the appeal of list comprehensions, but it is so hard for me to read sometimes. Sure it is more compact and runs faster, but it comes at the cost of readability, and I often miss details because of how dense it is. Personally, I think I will stick to regular loops. We also talked about how functions are also objects today, which is something I never thought to consider. As such, we can store them in variables, pass them as parameters, etc. In particular, it is difficult to wrap my head around how it could be passed as a parameter and returned from another function. I definitely need to look into it more.

#### Week 10

- We got the midterm solutions today. I’m pretty impressed with how many answers I got right. I only had one issue with the timeit question, but overall, I am happy. We covered more about decorators, and I am surprised by how versatile they can be. I wondered in what ways we could add additional functionality to a method, but it makes sense that we might want to use decorators to calculate the runtime of a function. I also realized that I have already used decorators before when I used the Flask library to create a website in my personal project. Back then, those decorators were just mysterious lines of code, but now, I have a better idea of what they do. However, I don't have access to what the decorator function looks like, so there is still some mystery involved. But I guess I will just have to trust that it can do its task as intended. I am a little confused, however, since I don't really know what the purpose of a wrapper is. Wouldn't the code run the same without one? Is it just for organization purposes? I'll have to look into it.

- Dynamic memory was covered in today’s lecture. I remember seeing that we couldn't use malloc and calloc in assignment 1, and I wondered what those functions did. Now we have a better idea. They are used to allocate memory for a certain size, returning a pointer to that memory address. We can then use it to create linked lists through self-referential data structures. I found it interesting how nodes are the only type that can be used before they are declared.

- We learned about singly linked lists, doubly linked lists, and circular lists. I remember learning about circular lists before in CSC 115, but I didn't realize how useful they can be in web development in addition to storage lists. They can be used to implement a carousel of sorts, where we loop back to the front of a slideshow after we reach the end. I also realized I implemented a circular list of sorts in my CSC 230 assignment 3, where when we reach the upper bound hexadecimal number on the LCD board, it circles back to the lower bound, and vice versa.

#### Week 11

- In addition to linked lists, we talked about trees. Their structure implementation is basically the same, except there are parent and right and left children pointers instead of just prev and next. I thought it was interesting how we can return the values of the binary search tree in ascending order if we do in-order traversal. At the end of the day, a tree is just a type of graph that is acyclic and connected, so it only makes sense that similar implementations can be made for all graph types. That was pretty interesting to learn about.

- We learned more about software engineering principles such as separation of concerns, low coupling, and high cohesion. Additionally, we learned about object-oriented programming in Python. So far, I've only done OOP in Java, and I'm surprised by the differences in Python. There are dunder functions that are automatically recognized in Python, and different ways of defining and accessing object and class variables.

- We talked about the different class relationships today. There are three that we know of now: is a, part of, and has a. It is pretty clear to me how "is a" differentiates from the rest of the relationships, but the difference between "part of" and "has a" is a little more ambiguous. I think that objectively, I know what the difference is, but code-wise, their implementation looks nearly identical. We also covered how ChatGPT can create class hierarchies and recreate a class hierarchy from a picture. That was something I found interesting.

#### Week 12

- I didn't know that we could use decorators for class functions. This makes calling each class function a lot simpler, as instead of doing something like obj.varsetter(4), we can do obj.var = 4. Besides that, each function for a field can have the same name, only differentiated task-wise through their respective decorator functions. I don't really understand why there isn't a @field.getter though. It would have looked more consistent that way.

- We started covering random variables in Python. After briefly going over the history, we talked about how we could use the random library in Python. I found it interesting how each deterministic random sequence can come from a seed for a generator. This is useful for testing, where we might need a repeatable sequence of random numbers. However, the part I found the most interesting was how we could use random numbers to calculate integrals. To do that, we use a technique where we repeat an action multiple times and observe the outcome. This sounds like an interesting project to add to my resume.

- We had midterm C today. I found this midterm to be challenging , but overall, I think I understood the topics well. Even so, I'm unsure how I performed on the test.

- ## 1. How did you experience Generative AI (e.g., chatGPT or Copilot) as a learning tool? This answer must be different from what you answered in TPP1 (i.e., the assumption is that you got to know chatGPT in the first part of the course and you really used it in the second part of the course).

***

My answer to this question is relatively the same as before. I still think that this is a great learning tool for CSC, Math, and English courses. However, I do have some additional insights since my answer in TPP1.

As a learning tool, I believe that Gen AI has the potential to help students in great ways. It has helped me personally with my projects. Before this month, I had never worked with Flask or Pillow, but now I can say that I have a better understanding of these libraries—enough to create a functioning website of my own. Granted, my knowledge is not complete, but I have a rough idea of how everything works. I don't believe I would have made this much progress without this tool, as Google and other resources don't provide responses tailored to your questions quite like Gen AI.

However, at the end of the day, Gen AI is still just a tool and not a replacement for critical thinking. There are times when the algorithm might send back misinformation, and it is still up to us humans to determine right from wrong. Additionally, it is a good idea to use this tool to deeply dive into topics you are unfamiliar with and not get too lazy, depending solely on this technology. Don't rely on ChatGPT to generate code without understanding what it does first, as it could bite you in the butt during debugging and management. In addition to Gen AI's contribution to human complacency, it is also a very memory and energy-expensive process.

I find that my battery drains faster during heavy ChatGPT sessions. Sometimes, I can even feel the heat through the keypad. This overheating issue might contribute to or be a symptom of high RAM usage. ChatGPT often lags and sometimes crashes, which is especially detrimental during midterms. Conversations and responses take multiple seconds to load. Even though it helps with the efficiency of your work, I dont think ChatGPT itself is a very memory or energy-efficient program.

## 20. What are your personal insights, aha moments, and epiphanies you experienced in the second part of the SENG 265 course?

Since my last entry, I learned a new method of prompt generation. Before, I would treat chat gpt just as a machine, using direct words that would convey my intent buntly. However, after observing Haussi's prompt writing, I started to notice trends: he writes politely and phrases everything like it is a question. Aparently doing this is the optimum way to commumicate with ChatGPT. There is a whole study dedicated to prompt engineering, which I wasnt previously aware of. This knowlege would definetly help me in the long run to make my chat gpt interactions more meaningful.
